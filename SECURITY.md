## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Verdaccio, we consider the security of our systems a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be vulnerabilities present. If you've discovered a vulnerability, please follow the guidelines below to report it to our team:

* Report it either [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure/) or [npmjs Security Team](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/report?package=verdaccio), they will be in contact with us in case of confirming the vulnerability.
* E-mail your findings to [verdaccio@pm.me](mailto:verdaccio@pm.me). If the report contains highly sensitive information, please consider encrypting your findings using our [PGP key](https://verdaccio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gpg/publickey.verdaccio@pm.me.asc).

Please follow these rules when testing/reporting vulnerabilities:
* Do not take advantage of the vulnerability you have discovered, for example by downloading more data than is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* Do not read, modify or delete data that isn't your own.
* We ask that you do not disclose the findings to third parties until it has been resolved.

What we promise:
* We will respond to your report within 3 business days with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date.
* We will keep you informed during all stages of resolving the problem.
* To show our appreciation for your effort and cooperation during the report, we will list your name and a link to a personal website/social network profile on the page below so that the public can know you've helped keep Verdaccio secure.
