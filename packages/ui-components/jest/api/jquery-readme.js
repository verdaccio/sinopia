  '# jQuery\n\n> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.\n\nFor information on how to get started and how to use jQuery, please see [jQuery\'s documentation](https://api.jquery.com/).\nFor source files and issues, please visit the [jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).\n\nIf upgrading, please see the [blog post for 3.6.3](https://blog.jquery.com/2022/12/20/jquery-3-6-3-released-a-quick-selector-fix/). This includes notable differences from the previous version and a more readable changelog.\n\n## Including jQuery\n\nBelow are some of the most common ways to include jQuery.\n\n### Browser\n\n#### Script tag\n\n```html\n<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.3.min.js"></script>\n```\n\n#### Webpack / Browserify / Babel\n\nThere are several ways to use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project\'s documentation. In the script, including jQuery will usually look like this:\n\n```js\nimport $ from "jquery";\n```\n\nIf you need to use jQuery in a file that\'s not an ECMAScript module, you can use the CommonJS syntax:\n\n```js\nvar $ = require( "jquery" );\n```\n\n#### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)\n\nAMD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend [require.js\' documentation](https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).\n\n```js\ndefine( [ "jquery" ], function( $ ) {\n\n} );\n```\n\n### Node\n\nTo include jQuery in [Node](https://nodejs.org/), first install with npm.\n\n```sh\nnpm install jquery\n```\n\nFor jQuery to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). This can be useful for testing purposes.\n\n```js\nconst { JSDOM } = require( "jsdom" );\nconst { window } = new JSDOM( "" );\nconst $ = require( "jquery" )( window );';
